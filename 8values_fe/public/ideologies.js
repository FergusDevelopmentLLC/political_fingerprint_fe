        // Marxist-De Leonism is a libertarian Marxist current developed by the American activist Daniel De Leon. De Leon was an early leader of the 
        // first United States socialist political party, the Socialist Labor Party of America (SLP). De Leon introduced the concept of Socialist Industrial Unionism.
        //
        // According to De Leonist theory, militant industrial unions are the vehicle of class struggle. Industrial unions serving the interests of the proletariat 
        // (working class) will be the needed republican structure used to establish a socialist system.

        // While sharing some characteristics of anarcho-syndicalism (the management of workplaces through unions) and with the SLP being a member of the predominantly
        // anarcho-syndicalist Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), De Leonism actually differs from it in that De Leonism, and its main proponent, the modern SLP, 
        // still believe in the necessity of a political party advocating a Constitutional amendment making the Union the government of industry. Central government 
        // would coordinate production. The party would cease to exist, as would the political state and that was its goal. No vanguardist elites are provided a base
